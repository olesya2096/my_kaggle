# my_kaggle

Different tasks from kaggle.


space_titanic-result.ipynb - is a notebook with the "Spaceship Titanic" assignment. In this competition your task is to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly. To help you make these predictions, you're given a set of personal records recovered from the ship's damaged computer system.

s3ep11.ipynb - is a notebook with the "Regression with a Tabular Media Campaign Cost Dataset" assignment. The task states: 'The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Media Campaign Cost Prediction dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance. For each id in the test set, you must predict the value for the target cost.'
